# Obsidian Note Annotations

Better active reading experience in Obsidian.

Currently implemented:

-   **Highlighting Mode**: automatically turn selected text in live preview mode into highlighted sections. Hold Command on Mac or Control on Windows to select text without highlighting. When Highlighting Mode is disabled, hold the modifier key to highlight text.
-   **Comments**: click highlighted text in live preview to add comments. Shown as margin notes in the reading view.
-   **Multicolor Highlights**: add `@{colorName}` to the comment to control the appearance of the highlight. Example: @yellow, @blue etc. Set available colors in the plugin options.

Limitations:

-   Highlighted text can't span multiple blocks or paragraphs
-   No markdown formatting or support for empty lines in comments
-   No editing of highlighted text. Switch to Source mode instead.
-   Only tested with Obsidian default theme
